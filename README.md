# Star Wars Crsis Mod for C&C3: Tiberium Wars  
This will be a Star Wars mod for Command & Conquer 3 Kane's Wrath, our hope is to make a new experience that will remain somewhat in the C&C3 style of gameplay while bringing some new elements for avid players of the C&C 3 series and hopefully a mod that be successful will add more variety to the already growing and exciting C&C 3 mods currently available  

We are still in the very early stages in developing the mod, currently we are working on the Empire and Rebel Factions and are in the process of making infantry, vehicles and aircraft models for each faction  

Our future plans are to eventually make some campaigns missions as well as add more factions from different era's of the Star Wars Universe such as Republic/CIS, Old Republic/Sith Empire, New Republic/Imperial Remnant, possibly even the Yuuzhan Vong, as well as many Pirate factions like the Hutt Cartel, Zann Consortium and much more to come
